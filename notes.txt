- What design pattern should I use for organizing my Java app? The app takes a String sent form Reaper script as an input.
The input String is a sequence of keySwitches decoded from midi notes. The maximum quantity of different keySwitches may be around 100.
The app decodes this String in Chord objects and works the entire way with them.
This sequence of chords should be connected following main Harmony and voiceLeading rules. The entire app is made for automating the use
of these rules.
The content of input String contains note messages form five tracks: main, soprano, alto, tenor and bass.
In the usual scenario the input String contains only the note midi messages from the main track which contains only keyswiches for
tonality, chord degree, scale, chord type and other information which influences the content and quality of the resulting sequence of chords,
except the musical notes.
Usually the notes form other tracks are ignored because they are generated by the app before, also they can be used for
harmonising given melody lines for each voice or preserving generated once,
and for this functionality a single keyswitch works for each separate track, above this keyswitch notes will be sent to the java app together with
keyswitches from the main track. Additionally the input String can contain keySwitches from the main track,
which do not provide any specific information for the chord to chose, but only the information about the timing of beginning and end
of any chord. The chord will be chosen by the app considering only the quantity of chords, timing, adjacent chords and notes from other
tracks if given.
